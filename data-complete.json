Michigan needs a growing population and growing paychecks to become one of the leading states in the country economically. I want to cut taxes and regulations at the state level. Additionally, I will focus on cutting auto insurance rates and fixing our 3rd grade reading scores, which are some of the lowest in the nation. My GROW (Great Readers On the Way) plan will prioritize literacy with a cabinet-level literacy director and more. Together these things will make Michigan more attractive to job creators and people, allowing our state to grow again."}, {"EDUCATION: What measures do you support/propose to achieve improved educational outcomes and accessibility for Michigan students from early childhood through post-secondary education?": "I support policies that give families more great educational choices and make wise use of taxpayers’ $15 billion annual investment in our schools. My GROW plan will reverse Michigan’s 15-year decline in reading scores with a cabinet-level literacy director, reading coaches in every elementary school, tutoring and summer reading programs. My Paycheck Training Plan will restore a balance between career and college preparation in our schools and foster apprenticeships in skilled trades and other fields. We should grade our schools A-F and reward high performing and improving schools with grants and incentives."}, {"ECONOMY: What policies do you support to increase jobs and help Michigan residents improve their economic positions?": "As governor, I will implement growth-friendly policies that make Michigan attractive to job creators and families and help rebuild our population. I will cut taxes and regulation at the state level I want to eliminate the Granholm income tax hike that has cost Michigan taxpayers $8 billion. There isn’t a problem facing Michigan today that couldn’t be made better if we had more people living and working in Michigan. We need more people filling jobs and contributing the growth that will allow us to invest in better roads and improved infrastructure."}, {"ENVIRONMENT & ENERGY: What actions or policies do you support to protect Michigan’s water, air and land for current and future generations, while meeting the state’s energy needs? Explain how those actions or policies would affect the future of Enbridge Pipeline 5.": "Our Great Lakes are the crown jewels of Michigan and their safety and security is etched in the DNA of every Michigan resident. I support building a 4.5-mile-long utility tunnel in the Straits that puts all existing utility connections into one underground concrete tunnel which would protect the lines from hazards and would also contain possible spills. Michigan must maintain a regulatory climate that provides reliable and affordable energy. I support a review of energy policy to provide a mix of nuclear, clean coal, natural gas, renewables and to encourage more choices for businesses, consumers and families."}, {"EQUALITY: What, if any, specific steps will you take to address inequalities facing women in Michigan?": "As attorney general I have established a strong record as being a voice for victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. I helped secure funding to test thousands of abandoned rape kids in Detroit and across the state and set up a special unit to prosecute human traffickers. I prosecuted Larry Nassar and he is behind bars for life. I also prosecuted Kevin Beverly, who threatened and intimidated his ex-wife from prison. As governor, I will continue this legacy of seeking justice for women."}, {"JUSTICE: What policies will you pursue to promote social and racial justice in our state?": "As attorney general, I have consistently been a voice for victims, consumers and all Michiganians, because I believe everyone should be treated equally under the law, with dignity and respect.

This in particular is a priority for me when I reach the Senate. 3. Infrastructure. Upgrading the Soo Locks and our roads must become a national priority."}, {"IMMIGRATION: What are your concerns and plans regarding U.S. immigration polices?": "We are a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. Our economy and national identity depend on a workable legal immigration system. But it needs to be tough as well. I oppose sanctuary cities and would work to ensure sanctuary cities are defunded. I also would work to ensure we have secure borders. I will work to support reform of the legal immigration system that provides greater security while supporting our economy."}, {"HEALTH CARE: What are your concerns and plans regarding U.S. health coverage policies and programs, including those affecting maternal and child health?": "We need to look at everything that comes in between a patient and their doctor. We must keep the decision making ability in the hands of doctors and health professionals. After that, we need to look at everything that happens after that patient walks out of the doctors office and has to pay for the care. We need to focus on patient-centered, market based solutions. Mothers and children across Michigan deserve better. Our Veterans deserve better."}, {"ECONOMY: What federal policies do you support to help members of all strata of the American public improve their economic positions?": "Michigan is one of the most innovative states in America. We are home to some of the most innovative manufacturing innovators in the world, and one of the most diverse agriculture sectors in the nation. Both of these important industries are sensitive to government regulation, tax and trade policy. The best thing the federal government can do in many cases is get out of the way. That means reducing regulation instead of increasing regulation. Putting in place a tax policy that helps create the environment where jobs can be created and where families keep more of what they earn to meet their needs."}, {"ENVIRONMENT & ENERGY: What policies do you support to meet U.S. energy needs while protecting our water, air and land for current and future generations? Explain how those actions or policies would affect the future of the Great Lakes.": "Our Great Lakes are a national treasure. They support a robust fish and tourism industry here in Michigan. We must protect the lakeshore and update infrastructure such as the Soo Locks to ensure the economic impact of the lakes to our state is not interrupted. I will champion policies and programs that protects environmental quality throughout the Great Lakes and protects them from invasive species like Asian Carp. The same applies to the land we farm and live on and the air we breathe. We enjoy an incredible agricultural diversity in this state and need to guarantee it for future seasons."}, {"ELECTIONS: What federal policies do you support regarding campaign funding and voting rights?": "As a cadet in the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Voting and sharing our opinions and values is how we pass on our democracy to future generations. We must protect the integrity of our elections and protect against voter fraud. It is equally important that we maintain a campaign finance system that is honest, transparent and accessible by every American citizen.

NAFTA & the TPA are destructive to the community of the 12th. So, foreign trade, funding the TPA, and the EX/IM Bank are extremely detrimental to American jobs. While Wall Street has proven prosperous in the recent short term, but education and an understanding of statistics run a cycle. Simple math and the education of the rules of 72, understanding debt, and how money works globally play an important part of overall economics. Most are unfamiliar with what the Federal Reserve represents and how our economic system works.

Most do not realize that based on population and census, we waste billions possibly trillions, on Congressional Districting that does not even represent U.S. Citizens. Based on Undocumented residents, almost 14 Congressional Districts are funded in this abuse of Taxpayer dollars. The Congress terms should be 6 years and limited to 2 cycles.
